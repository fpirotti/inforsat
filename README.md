# inforSAT
InforSAT wants to leverage open source tools for managing and analysing raster imagery data.   
In particular it uses the well-known GDAL and Mapserver suites to do band maths and extract and view indices over a Leaflet webgis framework. 

It provides users that want to learn how to collect spatio-temporal data from satellite imagery. Sentinel-2 images are implemented. Users can choose what index they want to view and/or analyze over all available image dates for user-defined specific polygons.

Data are processed on the original imagesin JP2 format, at 10/20 m resolution depending on the index.
